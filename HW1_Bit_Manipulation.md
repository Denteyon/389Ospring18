## Instructions
  
To complete the homework assignment, please go to the links above, begin a screen recording using [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/), or any other software that can record your screen, and begin coding! After that, upload the video to your Google Drive, and share the folder or video with your grading TA (listed [here](https://github.com/UMD-CS-STICs/389Ospring18/blob/master/Grading%20TA%20Assignments.pdf)) via private Slack message.

## Time Limit

You will get 1 hour to complete the two problems listed above. The points you can get for time is as follows:
  - 01:00 - 30 points
  - 01:06 - 27 points
  - 01:12 - 24 points

  - 01:48 - 6 points
  - 01:54 - 3 points
  - 02:00 - 0 points
 
 ## Complexity
 
 We will release the optimal complexities after the due date. For this homework, the most optimal space and time gets you 10 points, and you will lose 2 points per worsening time or space complexities.

## Due Date
Homework is due at 10:55AM on Friday, 2/9/2018 (immediately prior to class). 

There will be a 20% penalty per day for late submissions. The last time to hand in anything for credit is at 10:55AM on Wednesday, 2/14/2018.

## Grading
We will be grading on four different aspects:
- Effort
  - 30 points if you attempted the homework
- Test Cases
  - 30 points for passing test cases
- Timing 
  - 30 points for solving it in the allotted amount of time
  - Incrementally decreasing credit for solving in up to twice the allotted amount of time
  - 0 credit for academic dishonesty or not solving in up to twice the allotted amount of time
- Time and Space Complexity
  - 10 points for optimal solution
  - Incrementally decreasing credit for worse time and space complexities. Points will be out after the due date.

## Academic Honesty
We would like to remind you that this class is about YOU and improving YOUR interview skills. In a real interview (and for your midterm/final) you will have to think under time pressure. Given that, we know that you can look up the problem before hand, and solve it based on that. We are trusting you in being honest and doing your best, as we can give you feedback should we see you struggling with the problem.
