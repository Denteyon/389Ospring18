# CMSC389O: The Coding Interview 
## Prerequisites: C- or better in CMSC250 and CMSC216
## Credits: 1

## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive, practical introduction to technical interviews. The course will start with basic topics such as Big O and String Manipulation. We will then move into more complex topics such as Bit Manipulation and Dynamic Programming. Most of the classes will be in-class interviews to give real interview practice.

## Textbooks
Required: None

## Grading
Grades will be maintained on the CS Department <a href="https://grades.cs.umd.edu/">grades server</a>.

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted on the class repository, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following percentages:

| Percentage | Title | Description |
| ------------- | -----|-------- |
| 30% | Class Participation | Each class will require active participation from the students. |
| 20% | Homework  | Weekly individual homework that require video submission of solution. |
| 20% | Midterm | Two problems will be handed out (just like the homeworks). These problems will be more difficult than normal HW problems, but are the same format.  |
| 30% | Final | Three problems will be handed out (just like the homeworks). These problems will be more difficult than normal HW problems, but are the same format. |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted within one week of when it is returned. No requests
will be considered afterwards.

## Homework
Homework must be uploaded to YouTube __unlisted__. To submit your homework, upload a simple text file containing the link to your video to the submit server. The time limit for the video will be given for each homework assignment. Homework may not be submitted by any other means (e.g., please do not email your homework to us). It is your responsibility to verify that your video plays back properly before submitting. All homework is due by the start of the next class after it is assigned. This is a hard deadline, as we hand back solutions to the previous homework each class.

You may submit multiple times, but we will only view the latest submission.

## Outside-of-class communication with course staff
We will interact with students outside of class in primarily two ways: in-person during office hours and Slack. Email should be used sparingly and not for class related questions (e.g., homework).

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the <a href="http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx">Office of Student Conduct</a>.

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit http://www.shc.umd.edu.
