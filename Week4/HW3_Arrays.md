# Homework
- [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/)
- [First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/description/)
  
## Instructions
  
To complete the homework assignment, please go to the links above, begin a screen recording using [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/), or any other software that can record your screen, and begin coding! After that, upload the video to your Google Drive, and share the folder or video with your grading TA (listed [here](https://github.com/UMD-CS-STICs/389Ospring18/blob/master/Grading%20TA%20Assignments.pdf)) via private Slack message. Make sure you have it so that your TA can view the files, so that they can grade your work.

## New Instructions

This week, we'd like for you to complete a few tasks before closing your video.
  1. Show your code in full to us, and hold for a few seconds. If it is longer than the screen can fit, either zoom out, or hold the camera on the top part of the code for a few seconds, and then scroll to the code we cannot see.
  2. Use comments to explain to us your thought process, so that we may help you in future homeworks.
  3. Let us know if you are looking up anything during your video. If there's a blank screen for a while, we know you either went away or are looking up information. Tell us so we can skip to the good stuff!
  4. Write your time and space complexities for each solution you have as comments. This is good practice for interviews that ask you to analyze your code!

## Time Limit

You will get 90 minutes (1 hour, 30 minutes) to complete the two problems listed above. The points you can get for time is as follows:
  - 01:30 - 30 points
  - 01:39 - 27 points
  - 01:48 - 24 points
  - 01:57 - 21 points
  - 02:06 - 18 points
  - 02:15 - 15 points
  - 02:24 - 12 points
  - 02:33 - 9 points
  - 02:42 - 6 points
  - 02:51 - 3 points
  - 03:00 - 0 points
 
 ## Complexity
 
The optimal complexity for both homeworks is O(n) time, O(1) space. The scoring for each problem is as such:
  - O(n) time, O(1) space: 5 pts
  - O(n) time, O(n) space: 3 pts
  - O(n^k) time, O(n^k) space: 0 pts

## Due Date
Homework is due at 10:55AM on Friday, 2/23/2018 (immediately prior to class).

There will be a 20% penalty per day for late submissions. The last time to hand in anything for credit is at 10:55AM on Wednesday, 2/28/2018.

## Grading
We will be grading on four different aspects:
- Effort
  - 30 points if you attempted the homework
- Test Cases
  - 30 points for passing test cases
- Timing 
  - 30 points for solving it in the allotted amount of time
  - Incrementally decreasing credit for solving in up to twice the allotted amount of time
  - 0 credit for academic dishonesty or not solving in up to twice the allotted amount of time
- Time and Space Complexity
  - 10 points for optimal solution
  - Incrementally decreasing credit for worse time and space complexities.

## Extra Credit
In 1-2 paragraphs, explain how you would, given an array consisting of non-negative integers, count the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle. You can find the problem [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-triangle-number/description/). In your explanation, make sure that you discuss your Time and Space complexities, and the fundamental properties of the problem. What makes this question unique? What properties of these numbers can we use?

#### Examples:
  - Input: [2,2,3,4]
  - Output: 3
  - Explanation:
    Valid combinations are: 

    2,3,4 (using the first 2)

    2,3,4 (using the second 2)

    2,2,3

When you are writing your paragraph, write enough that we know you understand the problem and its applications. Use what you learned from class to help answer the question. The quality of your writing factors into the amount of extra credit you receive. Hand in your work to your graders via Slack as you would regular homework, with the label “Extra Credit Week 4.” Good luck!

EXTRA CREDIT IS DUE WHEN HOMEWORK IS DUE. WE WILL NOT ACCEPT LATE EXTRA CREDITS.

## Academic Honesty
We would like to remind you that this class is about YOU and improving YOUR interview skills. In a real interview (and for your midterm/final) you will have to think under time pressure. Given that, we know that you can look up the problem before hand, and solve it based on that. We are trusting you in being honest and doing your best, as we can give you feedback should we see you struggling with the problem.
